# node_odata_server_example
#The node OData server for the loopback framework example project

This is an example project for the [n-odata-server](https://github.com/htammen/n-odata-server).
It assumes that you have cloned the n-odata-server loopback component from github into a local folder named
`n-odata-server` that is at the same hierarchy level as this project. If you cloned n-odata-server into another
directory adjust the file package.json in this directory accordingly.

After you cloned this repository and the n-odata-server repository
run `npm install`
and then `node .`
to start the application.
